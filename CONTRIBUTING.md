# Issues

Just using the package and giving feedback is contributing. If
the package is not working as described, congratulations you've
discovered a bug! If you think this is the case, please submit an
issue to the github
[issue](https://github.com/MKLau/Rclean/issues) system. 

Include a reproducible example in the issue or a link to a
[gist](https://gist.github.com/), with the following:

1. Succinct title and description of expected results 
2. Code with library dependencies and representative data for input
3. Observed results description

Please check that the example runs in a fresh R session before
submitting. 

# Enhancements

If you haven't run into a bug, but would like the package to do
something that it currently doesn't, you're welcome to:

1. *Fork the repository and develop your own additions.* Take a look
   at how our code is structured (including the comments and help
   documentation). Also, develop appropriate tests to check that your
   code is correctly integrated and runs (see the [[tests]] directory).
2. *Submit an enhancement to the issue system.* We welcome new
   ideas. If you think there's a feature that would be useful for the
   community of users to have available in the package, but aren't
   able to develop it your self, please let us know.

# Retrospective Provenance

If you have used or are a developer who uses retrospective provenance
that is not currently handled by *Rclean*, please submit an
*enhancement* to the issue system. We'll be happy to help implement
it. 

# Thanks for contributing and keeping scientific software open!
