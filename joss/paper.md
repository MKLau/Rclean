Introduction
============

The growth of programming in the sciences has been explosive in the last
decade. This has facilitated the rapid advancement of science through
the agile development of computational tools. However, concerns have
begun to surface about the reproducibility of scientific research in
general (R. D. Peng et al. 2011 Baker (2016)) and the potential issues
stemming from issues with analytical software (Pasquier et al. 2017
Stodden, Seiler, and Ma (2018)). Specifically, there is a growing
recognition across disciplines that simply making data and software
"available" is not enough and that there is a need to improve the
transparency and stability of scientific software (Pasquier et al.
2018).

At the core of the growth of scientific computation, the `R` statistical
programming language has grown exponentially to become one of the top
ten programming languages in use today. At it's root R is a
*statistical* programming language. That is, it was designed for use in
analytical workflows; and the majority of the R community is focused on
producing code for idiosyncratic projects that are *results* oriented.
Also, R's design is intentionally at a level that abstracts many aspects
of programming that would otherwise act as a barrier to entry for many
users. This is good in that there are many people who use R to their
benefit with little to no formal training in computer science or
software engineering, but these same users can also be frequently
frustrated by code that is fragile, buggy and complicated enough to
quickly become obtuse even to the authors. The stability,
reproducibility and re-use of scientific analyses in R would be improved
by refactoring, which is a common practice in software engineering
(Martin 2009). From this perspective, tools that can lower the time and
energy required to refactor analytical scripts and otherwise help to
"clean" code, but abstracted enough to be easily accessible, could have
a significant impact on scientific reproducibility across all
disciplines (Visser et al. 2015).

To provide support for easier refactoring in R, we have created
`Rclean`. The `Rclean` package provides tools to automatically reduce a
script to the parts that are specifically relevant to a research product
(e.g. a scientific report, academic talk, research article, etc.).
Although potentially useful to all R coders, it was designed to ease
refactoring for scientists that use R but do not have formal training in
software engineering. Here, we detail the structure of the package's
API, describe the general workflow illustrated by an example use case
and provide some background on how data provenance enables the
underlying functionality of the package. We then end with a discussion
of future applications of data provenance in the context of "code
cleaning" and the potential integration with other software engineering
tools for the R community.

Methods
=======

The goal of `Rclean` is to provide a set of tools that help someone
reduce and organize code based on results. More often then not, when
someone is writing an R script, the intent is to produce a set of
results, such as a statistical analysis, figure, table, etc. This set of
results is always a subset of a much larger set of possible ways to
explore a dataset, as there are many statistical approaches and tests,
let alone ways to create visualizations and other representations of
patterns in data. This commonly leads to lengthy, complicated scripts
from which researchers manually subset results, but likely never to be
refactored because of the difficulty in disentangling the code needed to
produce some results and not others. The 'Rclean' package uses an
automated technique based on data provenance (details below) to analyze
existing scripts and provide ways to identify and extract code to
produce a desired output.

The API
-------

To keep the process simple and straight-forward much of this process has
been abstracted for the user, and the API has been kept to a minimum set
of functions that enable a user to conduct the following basic workflow:

1.  Obtain the "cleaned" code for a result(s).
2.  Transfer the code to a new context (e.g. a new script, function,
    reproducible example, web-app, etc.).
3.  Get information about the possible results and repeat as needed.

The package's main functions are `clean` and `keep`. When provided a
file path to a script and the name of a result (or a set of results),
`clean` analyzes the script's code and extracts the lines of code
required to produce the results. By default, code is formatted following
general best practices recommended by the Tidyverse via the `styler`
package (MÃ¼ller and Walthert 2019). This code can then be passed to the
`keep` function, which can either write the code to disk or copy the
code to the user's clipboard (if no output file path is supplied) and
the user can paste the code into another location (e.g. a script
editor).

In the process of cleaning a script, it is likely that a user will not
know the precise objects they want and might require some help analyzing
it. There are several functions to help with this process. The
`get_vars` function will return a list of possible results for a given
script at a supplied file path. This is obviously an important step, and
justifiably, the default behavior of the `clean` function is to run
`get_vars` if no results are supplied. To help with limiting and
checking the selection of results, the `code_graph` function creates a
network graph of the relationships among the various results and lines
of code in the script, which is the function used to create the figure
demonstrating data provenance @ref(fig:prov-graph). Last, the `get_libs`
function can be used to detect the packages that a given script depends
on, which it will return as coded library calls that can be inserted
into a cleaned script.

Data Provenance
---------------

All of these processes rely on the generation of data provenance. The
term provenance means information about the origins of some object. Data
provenance is a formal representation of the execution of a
computational process (<https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/>), to rigorously
determine the the unique computational pathway from inputs to results
(Carata et al. 2014). To avoid confusion, note that "data" in this
context is used in a broad sense to include all of the information
generated during computation, not just the data that are collected in a
research project that are used as input to an analysis. Having the
formalized, mathematically rigorous representation that data provenance
provides guarantees that the analyses that `Rclean` conducts are
theoretically sound. Most importantly, because the relationships defined
by the provenance can be represented as a graph, it is possible to apply
network search algorithms to determine the minimum and sufficient code
needed to generate the chosen result in the `clean` function.

There are multiple approaches to collecting data provenance, but
`Rclean` uses "prospective" provenance, which analyzes code and uses
language specific information to predict the relationship among
processes and data objects. `Rclean` relies on a library called
`CodeDepends` to gather the prospective provenance for each script. For
more information on the mechanics of the `CodeDepends` package, see
(Temple Lang et al. 2020). To get an idea of what data provenance is,
take a look at the `code_graph` function. The plot that it generates is
a graphical representation of the prospective provenance generated for
`Rclean` @ref(fig:prov-graph).

![Network diagram of the prospective data provenance generated for an
example script. Arrows indicate which lines of code (numbered) produced
which objects
(named).](paper_files/figure-markdown_strict/prov-graph-1.png)

Relatedly, it is important to point out that `Rclean` *does not* keep
comments present in code. This could be seen as a limitation of the data
provenance, which currently does not assign them a relationships.
Therefore, although there is often very useful or even invaluable
information in comments, the `clean` function removes them. This is a
general issue with automated methods for detecting the relationships
between comments and the code itself. Comments at the end of lines are
typically relevant to the line they are on, but this is not a
requirement and could refer to other lines. Also, comments occupying
their own lines usually refer to the following lines, but this is also
not necessarily the case. As `clean` depends on the unambiguous
determination of relationships in the production of results, it cannot
operate automatically on comments. However, comments in the original
code remain untouched and can be used to inform the reduced code. Also,
as the `clean` function is oriented toward isolating code based on a
specific result, the resulting code tends to naturally support the
generation of new comments that are higher level (e.g. "The following
produces a plot of the mean response of each treatment group."), and
lower level comments are not necessary because the code is simpler and
clearer.

In the future, it would also be useful to extend the existing framework
to support other provenance methods. One such possibility is
*retrospective provenance*, which tracks a computational process as it
is executing. Through this active, concurrent monitoring, retrospective
provenance can gather information that static prospective provenance
can't. Greater details of the computational process would enable other
features that could address some challenges, such as processing
information from comments, parsing control statements and replicating
random processes. However, using retrospective provenance comes at a
cost. In order to gather it, the script needs to be executed. When
scripts are computationally intensive or contain bugs that stop
execution, then retrospective provenance can not be obtained for part or
all of the code. Some work has already been done in the direction of
implementing retrospective provenance for code cleaning in R (see
<http://end-to-end-provenance.github.io>).

Results
=======

Example
-------

Data analysis can be messy and complicated, so it's no wonder that the
code often reflects this. "What did I measure? What analyses are
relevant to them? Do I need to transform the data? What's the function
for the analysis I want to run?" This is why having a way to isolate
code based on variables can be valuable. The following is an example of
a script that has some complications. As you can see, although the
script is not extremely long or complicated, it's difficult enough to
make it frustrating to visualize it in its entirety and pick through it.

So, let's say we've come to our script wanting to extract the code to
produce one of the results `fit_sqrt_A`, which is an analysis that is
relevant to some product. Not only do we want to double check the
results, we also want to use the code again for another purpose, such as
creating a plot of the patterns supported by the test. Manually tracing
through our code for all the variables used in the test and finding all
of the lines that were used to prepare them for the analysis would be
annoying and difficult, especially given the fact that we have used "x"
as a prefix for multiple unrelated objects in the script. Instead, we
can easily do this automatically with `Rclean`.

    library(Rclean)
    clean(script, "fit_sqrt_A")

    ## x <- 1:100
    ## x <- log(x)
    ## x <- x * 2
    ## x <- lapply(x, rep, times = 4)
    ## x <- do.call(cbind, x)
    ## x <- x * 2
    ## colnames(x) <- paste0("X", seq_len(ncol(x)))
    ## rownames(x) <- LETTERS[seq_len(nrow(x))]
    ## x <- t(x)
    ## x[, "A"] <- sqrt(x[, "A"])
    ## for (i in seq_along(colnames(x))) {
    ##   set.seed(17)
    ##   x[, i] <- x[, i] + runif(length(x[, i]), -1, 1)
    ## }
    ## x[, 1] <- x[, 1] * 2 + 10
    ## x[, 2] <- x[, 1] + x[, 2]
    ## x[, "A"] <- x[, "A"] * 2
    ## x <- data.frame(x)
    ## fit_sqrt_A <- lm(I(sqrt(A)) ~ B, data = x)

As you can see, `Rclean` has picked through the tangled bits of code and
found the minimal set of lines relevant to our object of interest. This
code can now be visually inspected to adapt the original code or ported
to a new, "refactored" script using `keep`.

    fitSA <- clean(script, "fit_sqrt_A")
    keep(fitSA)

This will pass the code to the clipboard for pasting into another
document. To write directly to a new file, a file path can be specified.

    fitSA <- clean(script, "fit_sqrt_A")
    keep(fitSA, file = "fit_SA.R")

To explore more possible variables to extract, the `get_vars` function
can be used to produce a list of the variables (aka. objects) that are
created in the script.

    get_vars(script)

    ## [1] "x"          "x2"         "i"          "x3"         "fit.23"    
    ## [6] "fit.xx"     "fit_sqrt_A" "z"          "fit_anova"

Especially when the code for different variables are entangled, it can
be useful to visual the code in order to devise an approach to cleaning.
As seen above @ref(fig:prov-graph), `code_graph` will produce a visual
of the code and the objects that they produce.

    code_graph(script)

![Example of the plot produced by the code\_graph function showing which
lines of code produce which variables and which variables are used by
other lines of
code.](paper_files/figure-markdown_strict/ex-code_graph-1.png)

After examining the output from `get_vars` and `code_graph`, it is
possible that more than one object needs to be isolated. To do this is
simple in `keep` by passing the set of desired objects to the *vars*
argument.

    clean(script, vars = c("fit_sqrt_A", "fit_anova"))

    ## x <- 1:100
    ## x <- log(x)
    ## x <- x * 2
    ## x <- lapply(x, rep, times = 4)
    ## x <- do.call(cbind, x)
    ## x2 <- sample(10:1000, 100)
    ## x2 <- lapply(x2, rnorm)
    ## x <- x * 2
    ## colnames(x) <- paste0("X", seq_len(ncol(x)))
    ## rownames(x) <- LETTERS[seq_len(nrow(x))]
    ## x <- t(x)
    ## x[, "A"] <- sqrt(x[, "A"])
    ## for (i in seq_along(colnames(x))) {
    ##   set.seed(17)
    ##   x[, i] <- x[, i] + runif(length(x[, i]), -1, 1)
    ## }
    ## x2 <- lapply(x2, function(x) x[1:10])
    ## x2 <- do.call(rbind, x2)
    ## x[, 1] <- x[, 1] * 2 + 10
    ## x[, 2] <- x[, 1] + x[, 2]
    ## x[, "A"] <- x[, "A"] * 2
    ## x <- data.frame(x)
    ## fit_sqrt_A <- lm(I(sqrt(A)) ~ B, data = x)
    ## z <- c(rep("A", nrow(x2) / 2), rep("B", nrow(x2) / 2))
    ## fit_anova <- aov(x2 ~ z, data = data.frame(x2 = x2[, 1], z))

Currently, because of the data provenance that is used, libraries can
not be isolated directly during the cleaning process. So, the `get_libs`
function provides a way to detect the libraries for a given script. Just
supply a file path and `get_libs` will return the libraries that are
called by that script.

    get_libs(script)

    ## [1] "stats"

is open-source and welcomes contributions. Please visit the repository
page to report issues, request features or provide other feedback.

Discussion
==========

We have created `Rclean` to provide a simple, easy to use tool for
scientists who would like help refactoring code. Using `Rclean` the code
necessary to produce a specified result (e.g., an object stored in
memory or a table or figure written to disk) can be easily and
*reliably* isolated even when tangled with code for other results. This
functionality is enabled by graph analysis of data provenance collected
from the user's script. This is likely to be a broadly useful tool as
statistical programming becomes more common across the sciences. Tools,
such as this, that make it easier to produce transparent, accessible
code will be an important aid for improving scientific reproducibility.

Although the workflow described is impactful, we see promise in
extending it to interface with other clean code and reproducibility
tools. One example is the `reprex` package, which provides a simple API
for sharing reproducible examples (Bryan et al. 2019). Another
possibility is to help transition scripts to function, package and
workflow creation and refactoring via toolboxes like `drake` (Landau
2020). `Rclean` could provide a reliable way to extract parts of a
larger script that would be piped to a simplified reproducible example,
in the case of `reprex`, or, since it can isolate the code from inputs
to one or more outputs, be used to extract all of the components needed
to write one or more functions that would be a part of a package or
workflow, as is the goal of `drake`.

To conclude, we hope that `Rclean` makes writing scientific software
easier for the R community. We look forward to feedback and help with
extending its application, particularly in the area of reproducibility.
