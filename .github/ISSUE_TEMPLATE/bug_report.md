## Description

Describe the bug clearly and concisely. 

## Reproducible example

Provide a minimal reproducible example with code and output that
demonstrates the problem. The `reprex()` function from the
[`reprex`](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) package is extremely
helpful for this.

To help us read your code, please try to follow the
[tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The
`style_text()` and `style_file()` functions from the
[`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package make it easier.

## Expected result

What should have happened? Please be as specific as possible.

## Session info

End the reproducible example with a call to `sessionInfo()` in the
same session (e.g. `reprex(si = TRUE)`) and include the output.
