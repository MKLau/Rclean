Clean up your code
==================

- [Rclean](https://github.com/ProvTools/Rclean) was created to help
    scientists more *easily* write “cleaner” code.
- Written with research scientists that are results oriented in mind,
    the package’s primary function provides a simple way to isolate
    the minimal code you need to produce a specific result, such as a
    statistical table or a figure. By focusing on specific results
    (aka. variables), large and/or complicated analytical scripts can
    be paired down to the essentials and easily re-factored to be more
    robust and easily shared.
- The following is a brief introduction to the package. For more
  details, see `vignette("Rclean")`.


Install
=======

You can install
[Rclean](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rclean/) from *CRAN*: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("Rclean")
```

You can install the most up to date version easily with
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MKLau/Rclean")
```

You will also likely need to install the
[RGraphViz](bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rgraphviz.html):

```{R rgraphviz}

if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("Rgraphviz")

```

Once installed, per usual R practice just load the *Rclean* package
with:

```{r eval = TRUE}
library(Rclean)
```

Usage
=====

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
library(CodeDepends)
script <- system.file(
    "example", 
    "simple_script.R", 
    package = "Rclean")

```

*Rclean* usage is simple. Have a script with code you want to clean
saved to disk. Then, just run the `clean` function with the path to
the script as the input. Here, we can use an example script that is
included with the package:

```{r eval = FALSE} 
script <- "example/simple_script.R"

```

Here's a quick look at the code:


```{r eval = TRUE}
readLines(script)

```



You can get a list of the variables found in an object with
`get_vars`. 

```{r eval = TRUE}
get_vars(script)

```

Sometimes for more complicated scripts, it can be helpful to see a
 network graph showing the interdependencies of
 variables. `code_graph` will produce a network diagram showing which
 lines of code produce or use which variables (e.g. 1 -> "out"):

```{r eval = TRUE}
code_graph(script)
```

Now, we can pick the result we want to focus on for cleaning:


```{r eval = TRUE}
clean(script, "tab.15")
```

We can also select several variables at the same time:

```{r eval = TRUE}
my.vars <- c("tab.12", "tab.15")
clean(script, my.vars)
```

While just taking a look at the simplified code can be very helpful,
you can also save the code for later use or sharing (e.g. creating a
reproducible example for getting help) with `keep`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
my.code <- clean(script, my.vars)
keep(my.code, file = "results_tables.R")
```

If you would like to copy your code to your clipboard, you can do that
by not specifying a file path. You can now paste the simplified as needed.

```{r eval = FALSE}
keep(my.code)
```
